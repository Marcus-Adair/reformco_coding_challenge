# Marcus Adair - Reform Collective Coding Challenge

A React app implementing some 2D animations, built with [GSAP](https://gsap.com/) and styled using Tailwind CSS.

See at: [https://marcus-adair.github.io/reformco_coding_challenge/](https://marcus-adair.github.io/reformco_coding_challenge/)

Note: This defintely has room for imporovement and polishing, this was my first go at using GSAP, which is an awesome package!

Basically all of the HTML and CSS was written by hand. I used GSAP Docs, AI (ChatGPT), [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW1yfBKRMKc&t=203s), and experimentation to learn and implement the GSAP animations. I'm excited to learn more about GSAP!

### Future Work

- Optimize for mobile & different browsers, register colors as vars instead of hardcoding hex colors, smoother transitions/better centering for CardScroller (adjust ease values and more to make look like video more?), integrate more fonts besides just 'soehne-buch.woff2', and more.
